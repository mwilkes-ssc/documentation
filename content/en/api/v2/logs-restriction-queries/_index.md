title: Logs Restriction Queries
description: >-
  **Note: This endpoint is in public beta. If you have any feedback, contact

  To grant read access on log data at all, you must grant the `logs_read_data`
  permission.

  From there you can limit what data a role grants read access to by associating
  a Restriction Query with that role.


  A Restriction Query is a logs query that restricts which logs the
  `logs_read_data` permission grants read access to.

  For users whose roles have Restriction Queries, any log query they make only
  returns those log events that also match

  one of their Restriction Queries. This is true whether the user queries log
  events from any log-related feature, including

  the log explorer, Live Tail, re-hydration, or a dashboard widget.


  Restriction Queries currently only support use of the following components of
  log events:


  - Reserved attributes

  - The log message

  - Tags


  The recommended way to manage restricted read access on log data for customers
  with large or complicated organizational structures

  is to add a team tag to log events to indicate which team(s) own(s) them, and
  then to scope Restriction Queries to the appropriate

  values of the team tag. Tags can be applied to log events in many ways, and a
  log event can have multiple tags with the same key (like team)

  and different values—in this way the same log event can be visible to roles
  whose restriction queries are scoped to different team values.


  You need an API and application key with Admin rights to interact with this
  endpoint.

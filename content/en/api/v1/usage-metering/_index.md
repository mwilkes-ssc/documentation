description: >-
  The usage metering API allows you to get hourly, daily, and

  monthly usage across multiple facets of Datadog.

  This API is available to all Pro and Enterprise customers.

  Usage is only accessible for [parent-level
  organizations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/).


  **Note**: Usage data is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was incurred.

  It is retained for the past 15 months.

title: Metrics
description: |-
  The metrics endpoint allows you to:

  - Post metrics data so it can be graphed on Datadog’s dashboards
  - Query metrics from any time period

  **Note**: A graph can only contain a set number of points
  and as the timeframe over which a metric is viewed increases,
  aggregation between points occurs to stay below that set number.

  Datadog has a soft limit of 100 timeseries per host
  where a timeseries is defined as a unique combination of metric name and tag.

  SubmitMetrics:
    description: >-
      The metrics end-point allows you to post time-series data that can be
      graphed on Datadog’s dashboards.

      The maximum payload size is 3.2 megabytes (3200000). Compressed payloads
      must have a decompressed size of up to 62 megabytes (62914560).


      If you’re submitting metrics directly to the Datadog API without using
      DogStatsD, expect


      - 64 bits for the timestamp

      - 64 bits for the value

      - 20 bytes for the metric names

      - 50 bytes for the timeseries

      - The full payload is approximately ~ 100 bytes. However, with the
      DogStatsD API,

      compression is applied, which reduces the payload size.

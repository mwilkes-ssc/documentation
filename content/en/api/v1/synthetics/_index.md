  Datadog Synthetics uses simulated user requests and browser rendering to help
  you ensure uptime,

  identify regional issues, and track your application performance. Datadog
  Synthetics tests come in

  two different flavors, [API
  tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/?tab=httptest)

  and [browser tests][1]. You
  can use Datadog’s API to

  manage both test types programmatically.


  For more information about Synthetics, see the [Synthetics
  overview](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/).
